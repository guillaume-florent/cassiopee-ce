r"""Computes the matching connectivity for a portion of cylinder

This tutorial demonstrates how to compute the periodic match connectivity
in the case of an azimuthal periodicity.

Computes the periodic match connectivity of a quarter of cylinder by S. PÃ©ron.

Suppose you have a periodic mesh in azymuth and want to compute the
periodic match connectivity.
The idea is to duplicate the meshes by rotation and then perform
a X.connectMatch on the full mesh. Since zone names in the duplicated mesh
are the same as in original mesh, this will result in a correct connectivity.
Then, we perform the same thing for the other direction.
