    <h3>Preamble</h3>
    
    Dist2Walls gathers efficient algorithms for computing the distance fields 
    for arrays (as defined in Converter documentation) or 
    for CGNS/python tree (pyTrees).<br><br>

    This module is part of Cassiopee, a free open-source 
    pre- and post-processor for CFD simulations.<br><br>

    When using the Converter array interface,
    a (or b) denotes an array, and A (or B) denotes a list of arrays.
    Then, Dist2Walls module must be imported: 
    <div class="code">
    import Dist2Walls as DTW
    </div>

    When using the pyTree interface, import the module:
    <div class="code">
     import Dist2Walls.PyTree as DTW
    </div>
    In that case, a is a zone node and A is a list of zone nodes or a pyTree.<br>

    <p></p>
    <h3>Module functions</h3>
    <p></p>
    <strong>DTW.distance2Walls </strong>: computes the distance field from a set of bodies.<br>
    compute the distance field located at nodes or centers of zone a (or zones in A), provided a list 
    of surfaces defining the bodies to which the distance is computed. <br>
    Two algorithms are available: <br>
    - type='ortho' means a distance computed by an orthogonal projection to the surface faces defined by bodies. <br>
    - type='mininterf' returns the minimum distance of the point to the vertices of bodies.<br>

    If loc='nodes', returns a distance computed at nodes of a (A), else if loc='centers, distance is computed at cell centers
    of a (A). <br>
    Parameter 'signed'=1 enables to compute a signed distance (negative inside bodies). <br>
    When using signed distances, each body in bodies list must be a closed and watertight surface.<br>
    In array version, cellnbodies provides the 'cellN' field for any vertex in bodies. Default value is 1.<br>
    The algorithm 'ortho' does not take into account a body face if cellN=0 for all the vertices of that face.<br>
    The algorithm 'mininterf' does not compute the distance to a vertex of cellN=0. <br>
    <div class="code">
      b = DTW.distance2Walls(a, bodies, cellnbodies=[], type='ortho', loc='centers', signed=0, dim=3) <em>.or.</em>
      B = DTW.distance2Walls(A, bodies, cellnbodies=[], type='ortho', loc='centers', signed=0, dim=3)
    </div>
    In the pyTree version, 'cellN' variable must be stored in bodies directly. <br>
    If loc='nodes', the distance field is stored as a 'TurbulentDistance' field located at nodes, and 
    if loc='centers', it is stored in nodes located at centers: <br>
    <div class="code">
      b = DTW.distance2Walls(a, bodies, type='ortho', loc='centers', signed=0, dim=3) <em>.or.</em>
      B = DTW.distance2Walls(A, bodies, type='ortho', loc='centers', signed=0, dim=3)
    </div>
